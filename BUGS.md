# Bugs

Message Window:
Last message is not visible, as its partially covered by the input row.
Scrollbar goes under the input row. Scrollbar should only be in the Message Block.
When on mobile view, the name of the user and the role take two lines. It should be contained in one line.
There should be a bit more space between the Message Window and the Input Row.

Input Row:
Send button should be of roughly the same size across views, and have a rectangular shape.
There should be space between the text input and the button.
The text input should not have a blue glow.
Input Row should not expand outside of the Message Window.

Message List:
The overall styling is off.
Names and roles of users should be contained in a single line.
Photos should be displayed on the first column (left), name and role on the right column.
The font size for name should be smaller, like the one on the Message Window.
Search bar should have consistent padding, as well as styling.
Scrollbar should be contained inside the Message List element.

### Styling Consistency: Inconsistency in the className of some elements.
