## Packages

I've been having trouble with npm packages. I've switched to yarn but left the package.json file in the directory, in case we determine to go back to npm.

## TODO

- Fetch Real Data
- Error Handling
  - Boundaries âœ“
  - Event Listeners
- Loading States
- Unit Testing
- Redux Implementation
- ? PropTypes ?
